## 🚀 Project Overview

> This project presents a smart and scalable heart disease prediction system leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques. Our proposed **TAB-HRAE-LSTM** model significantly outperforms traditional models in accuracy and real-world usability.

📌 **Key Features**:
- Accurate prediction of cardiovascular disease using Cleveland dataset
- Combines classical ML + DL + Ensemble techniques
- Real-time prediction interface with Streamlit
- Web backend powered by Firebase
- Visual insights through charts, ROC curves & confusion matrix

## 🎯 Goals

- ⛑ Reduce heart disease risk through early detection  
- 🤖 Use AI models (KNN, SVM, RF, XGBoost, MLP, LSTM)  
- 🧠 Deploy hybrid deep learning model TAB-HRAE-LSTM  
- 🌐 Build an interactive web app for real-time health screening
